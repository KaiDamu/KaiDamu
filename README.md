### My journey
I'm a **backend developer** and part-time **gamer**, **programming since 2015**. My parents made the mistake of letting me try a computer game at the **age of 3**, this **changed my life** in an exciting direction... Although I liked computer games and software, my interest **shifted** with time. I wanted to **know how the software works**, and I had a bunch of ideas I wanted to see happen and **create my own software**. This got me into programming at the **age of 13**. Then I had **formal IT education for 5 years**, which contributed relatively little to my knowledge because **I taught myself** much more outside of school. My **logic** and **problem-solving** skills were always **unexpectedly high** relative to my peers. Being gifted allowed me to **bring my ideas to life**, all the **100+ projects** through the years. This makes me say; programming really is **my passion**. I'm aiming for making this world a **better place** by writing both hobby and production code, at scale.
